# the progress style is "dot". "Dot" is the default style when Wget is run in
# the background (e.g. using "wget -b" or "nohup wget"). Based on the source
# code, these are the values:
# * default: 1 dot = 1 KiB,  1 cluster = 10 dots, 1 line = 5 clusters = 50 KiB
# * binary:  1 dot = 8 KiB,  1 cluster = 16 dots, 1 line = 3 clusters = 384 KiB
# * mega:    1 dot = 64 KiB, 1 cluster = 8 dots,  1 line = 6 clusters = 3 MiB
# * giga:    1 dot = 1 MiB,  1 cluster = 8 dots,  1 line = 4 clusters = 32 MiB
# Note that you can override this with the "dot_bytes", "dot_spacing" and
# "dots_in_line" settings.
