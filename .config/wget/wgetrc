# You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
# avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
# not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
# to find out what you can put into this file. You can find this here:
#   
#   $ info wget.info 'Startup File'
# 
# Or online here:
#   https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Startup-File
#
# Wget initialization file can reside in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
# (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
#
# Command are case-, underscore- and minus-insensitive.
# For example ftp_proxy, ftp-proxy and ftpproxy are the same.

# Global settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
# functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation.

# You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
# optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
# default quota is unlimited.
#quota = inf

# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
# downloading a file (default is 20).
#tries = 20

# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
#reclevel = 5

# By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
# initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
# way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
# computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
# firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
# problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
# environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
#passive_ftp = off

# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
#waitretry = 10


# Local settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
# *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
# they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
#
# Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
# are doing before doing so.

# Use UTF-8 as the default system encoding
# `--local-encoding`.
local_encoding = UTF-8

# Turn verbose on/off—the same as ‘-v’/‘-nv’
# verbose = on

# Retry a few times when a download fails, default is 20
tries = 5

# Wait n seconds between retrievals—the same as ‘-w n’.
# wait = 5

# Wait up to n seconds between retries of failed retrievals only
# the same as ‘--waitretry=n’
# Note that this is turned on by default in the global wgetrc.
# wait-retry = 5

# Consider `connection refused` a transient error
# `--retry-connrefused`.
retry_connrefused = on

# Add a `.html` extension to `text/html` or `application/xhtml+xml` files that
# lack one, or a `.css` extension to `text/css` files that lack one
# `-E`.
adjust_extension = on

# Use the server-provided last modification date, if available
# `-N`
timestamping = on

# Wait 60 seconds before timing out. This applies to all timeouts: DNS, connect and read. (The default read timeout is 15 minutes!)
# `-T n`
timeout = 60

# Set the connect timeout
# `--connect-timeout`.
connect_timeout = 15

# Set the DNS timeout—
# `--dns-timeout`.
dns_timeout = 60

# Set the read (and write) timeout
# like `--read-timeout=n`.
read_timeout = 60

# Do not go up in the directory structure when downloading recursively
# `--no-parent`.
no_parent = on

# By default, resume transfers by starting the download at N bytes, where N is
# the current size of the local file. 
# Note that this can be dangerous when you want to overwrite an existing file.
# In that case, you can use "-O your.file" to force overwriting, or 
# "--continue=no" to disable resuming.
# Force continuation of preexistent partially retrieved files
# `--c`.
continue = on

# Do not download robots.txt and ignore <meta name="robots"> tags
robots = off

# Follow FTP links from HTML files by default
# `--follow-ftp`.
follow_ftp = on

# If set to on, construct the local file name from redirection URLs rather than original URLs.
trust_server_names = on

# Turn on recognition of the (non-standard) ‘Content-Disposition’ HTTP header 
# the same as ‘--content-disposition’.
# This will save "http://example.com/download.php?id=123" as "foo.txt" instead 
# of "download.php?id=123" when there is a header that says 
# "Content-Disposition: ...; filename=foo.txt".
content_disposition = on

# Print the HTTP and FTP server responses
# `-S`
server_response = on

# When set to on, retrieve symbolic links as if they were plain files
# `--retr-symlinks`
# retr_symlinks = on

# Restrict the file names generated by Wget from URLs
# See ‘--restrict-file-names’ for a more detailed description
# restrict_file_names = unix

# Force Wget to use encoding as the default remote server encoding
# See ‘--remote-encoding’
# remote_encoding = UTF-8

# Force Wget to use encoding as the default system encoding
# See ‘--local-encoding’
# local_encoding = UTF-8

# `-nc`
# no_clobber = on

# Set the type of the progress indicator. Legal types are ‘dot’ and ‘bar’
# Equivalent to ‘--progress=string’.
progress = bar

# Define user agent identification header
 # `--user-agent=string`.
user_agent = Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0

# Determine the amount of data that is represented by one line of dots when
# the progress style is "dot". "Dot" is the default style when Wget is run in
# the background (e.g. using "wget -b" or "nohup wget"). Based on the source
# code, these are the values:
# * default: 1 dot = 1 KiB,  1 cluster = 10 dots, 1 line = 5 clusters = 50 KiB
# * binary:  1 dot = 8 KiB,  1 cluster = 16 dots, 1 line = 3 clusters = 384 KiB
# * mega:    1 dot = 64 KiB, 1 cluster = 8 dots,  1 line = 6 clusters = 3 MiB
# * giga:    1 dot = 1 MiB,  1 cluster = 8 dots,  1 line = 4 clusters = 32 MiB
# Note that you can override this with the "dot_bytes", "dot_spacing" and
# "dots_in_line" settings.
